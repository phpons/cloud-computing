If you want, you can use Eclipse as an IDE for C development, 
you only need to install the tool "CDT" as a regular plugin from 
the regular Eclipse install site.

With CDT installed, you can launch Eclipse on the workspace and
switch to the Eclipse perspective that is suited for C development. 
Then, you can create a C/C++ project with the name "arm.boot". 
Choose the option of a project with its own makefile. 
That's it, you can browse and compile and execute.

To debug with QEMU, you simply need to create a debug configuration 
for the executable "kernel.elf". Right click on the executable "kernel.elf"
and select "Debug Configurations". Under the "Debugger" tab, you need to set 
the gdb information and the remote target information:

    GDB Client Set

        Executable name: arm-none-eabi-gdb

    Remote Target

            localhost

            1234

To debug, launch QEMU in another terminal, using "make debug", and
then launch gdb from within Eclipse. 

Using gdb from Eclipse provides better integration with the development process
but the gdb console is a real pain to use. So, for fancy use of the gdb console,
you may want to stay using command-line version of gdb, experimenting with the
gdb tui layouts with an enlarged terminal window.
